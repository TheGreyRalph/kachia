Their mission was to survey the land and find a suitable administrative headquarters for the Northern Protectorate as well as a site for military exercises. </p><p> By August of that year, the patrol had collected topographical data for a location known as Kaduna. During their journey, the patrol team was attacked by a local pagan tribe, mistaking them for slave raiders who frequently traveled the same route from Zaria to Kaduna, Keffi, and Borno. This route, which is now a motorable road, connects Kano, Zaria, Kaduna, Kachia, Keffi, and beyond, passing through Benue to southern Nigeria. </p></section><section class="md:px-32 px-5 py-5 flex text-base flex-col gap-5 font-playfair"><h2 class="text-green-main font-semibold"> Military Range and Artillery </h2><p> Kachia later became notable for housing Nigeria&#39;s famous military range and is the headquarters of the Nigeria Army Corps of Artillery.

Despite its military prominence, Kachia has seen limited economic development over the years. </p><p> During the Nigerian Civil War in the 1960s, Kachia was the planned site for the northern elements&#39; counter-coup against General Aguiyi Ironsi\u2019s regime. In July 1966, General Ironsi visited Kachia for military exercises, and rumors of unrest led him to summon General Hassan Usman Katsina, who was then a Major and Governor of the Northern Region.
