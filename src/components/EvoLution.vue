        Kachia, one of the oldest towns in Kaduna State, has a rich historical
        and political legacy. It played a key role in the pre-colonial and
        post-colonial eras, becoming a prominent center under the Zaria Native
        Authority. It has contributed to Nigeria's political development,
        producing notable leaders. Kachia is geographically bordered by Kajuru,
        Jaba, Kagarko, Zongon Kataf, and parts of Niger State, with a population
        of 244,274 (2006 census) and a landmass of 4,000 sq km.

        Kachia is home to Africa's famous military range, the Gurara River, rich
        cultural sites like the Jaba Kogo rocks and Kuturmi mountains, and the
        annual festivals of the HAM, Kadara, and Kuturmi peoples. Its Guinea
        Savannah climate brings a wet season from April to October and a dry
        season with harmattan winds from November to March.

        Agriculture is central, with farming cycles following the rains, and the
        Laduga grazing reserve supports pastoral activities. Established in
        1976, Kachia originally comprised five districts and now serves as the
        headquarters of one of the state's Local Government Areas. Several
        districts, including Kaduna South, Chikun, Kajuru, and Zangon Kataf,
        have since emerged from this region.
