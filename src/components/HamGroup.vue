        <p class="text-body1 text-justify">
          The Ham people, also known as the Jaba, inhabit the southern and
          southeastern parts of Kachia Local Government Area. According to oral
          tradition, their ancestral origins trace back to southern Egypt. It is
          said they migrated southwards along the Nile Valley, crossed through
          regions around northeastern Africa (possibly Chad or Borno), and
          finally settled in their present locations.

        <p class="text-body1 text-justify q-mt-md">
          In Kachia, they are affectionately called
          <strong>"Jaba Ketare"</strong> because they live across the tributary
          of the Gurara River. Their settlements are known for their rich
          cultural practices, closely tied to the land and natural surroundings.
