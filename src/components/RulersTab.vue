      Rulers of Kachia
    </h1>
    <p class="text-gray-600 font-playfair text-sm md:text-lg mb-4">
      Historically, the leadership in Kachia was not formally organized. Brave
      and intelligent warriors led the people, and as time progressed, the
      people began to organize themselves under more formal leadership
      structures.

      Kachia was traditionally governed by village heads (Sarakuna), with the
      first being Mal. Idi Magaji Maikalgo, followed by other notable leaders.
      These are the rulers of Kachia:

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
      <li>Mal. Idi Magaji Maikalgo</li>
      <li>Mal. Jarmai</li>
      <li>Mal. Kato</li>
      <li>Mal. Musa Magaji Ali (Bamaguje)</li>
      <li>Mal. Nagwamatse (Fulani Stock)</li>
      <li>Mal. Arso (Fulani Stock)</li>
      <li>Mal. Abubakar I</li>
      <li>Mal. Abubakar II</li>
      <li>Alh. Sani Abubakar</li>
      <li>Engr. Tanimu Badamasi (current Sarkin Kachia)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm md:text-lg mt-4">
      Over time, the village administration in Kachia was influenced by the
      Fulani or Habe system, which was likely adopted through contact with the
      Hausas. The ruling houses today are those of Sani Abubakar Danladi Shugaba
      and Musa Sarkin Kachia.
