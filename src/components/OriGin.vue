        Origin of the Name "Kachia"
      </h2>
      <p>
        The name "Kachia" originated from the experiences of merchants
        who visited the town. Although there was an abundance of food
        and drink, accommodation was scarce. Merchants would exclaim,
        "kaci kasha babu wurin kwana" meaning, "You eat and drink but
        there's no place to sleep," which eventually led to the name
        "Kachia."

        Kachia Wall (Ganuwa)
      </h2>
      <p>
        Kachia was fortified by a large wall called Ganuwa to protect it
        from tribal wars and slave raiders. The wall, now in ruins, had
        four main gates: Kofar Shahu, Kofar Kurmin Biri, Kofar Gaiyan,
        and Kofar Kusfa.

        Wards (Ungwa) of Kachia
      </h2>
      <p>
        Kachia was divided into various wards based on ethnic groups.
        For example, Ungwan Madaka/Katagan housed mostly the Kadara
        people, while Kwantaro had a mix of Hausa butchers and Jaba
        people. Ungwan Kusfa was predominantly Kuturmi, and Ungwan Gabas
        housed people of Damau origin, who were once servants to the
        Emir of Zazzau.

      <p>
        Gumel, predominantly inhabited by the Bajju people, was
        originally settled by hunters who found the land suitable for
        both hunting and farming. After a tragic incident involving a
        wild beast, they decided to settle permanently in the area.
