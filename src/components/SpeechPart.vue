              <p>
                Let me begin by giving thanks to the Almighty God for making
                this day a reality and to welcome you all to this auspicious
                occasion. May I also use this platform to thank His Excellency
                Sen. Uba Sani, the Executive Governor of Kaduna state and the
                good people of Kachia local government for believing in us and
                to entrust us with the mandate to serve. And by God's grace and
                prayers, we will not fail.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-4">
                Today's ceremony is to swear in the twelve (12) newly elected
                Councillors of our local government.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-4">
                The elections have come and gone, and in the spirit of
                sportsmanship, there is always a winner and loser. However, in
                this case, we are all winners, No Victor No Vanquish. This is so
                because we're brothers and sisters, we all have a common goal to
                salvage Kachia through providing equitable service delivery and
                the development of the only home we can call ours - Kachia Local
                Government Area.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-4">
                To our newly elected councillors who shall later be inaugurated
                as the legislative arm of this government, I charge you all to
                uphold the sanctity of the mandate entrusted to you by your
                people. This you will do by being responsive to the yearnings
                and aspirations of our people.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-4">
                Let me also advise that it will make you more responsive and
                accountable leaders to create an office in your ward where you
                will engage your people on better service delivery at the
                grassroots. Your presence in your ward will pay off instead of
                coming to the local government headquarters to rent a house,
                thereby making it difficult for electorates to access you.

              <p class="mt-4 md:mt-0">
                May I also stress here that we shall remain resolute in
                translating our vision and mission of RESPONSIBILITY to the
                people towards achieving a New Kachia. To hit the ground
                running, I have constituted a Transition Committee, which in a
                short moment from now I will inaugurate. The term of reference
                of this committee shall be to facilitate a smooth transition
                from the outgoing administration to the incoming one. This is to
                ensure uninterrupted governance at this level.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-4">
                Permit me at this juncture to state here that the Transition
                Committee shall be under the Chairmanship of Mr. Ezra Zubairu
                with Dr. Jay Danjuma Daniel as Secretary. In carrying out its
                assignment, it shall undertake a comprehensive review of the
                ongoing projects, assess the current state of affairs and
                liabilities, and recommend priority actions that will support my
                administration. This committee is to serve as a bridge builder
                for continuity of effective and efficient service delivery to
                our people in all the twelve (12) wards of our local government.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-4">
                Let me call on us that as we await the outcome of the Transition
                Committee report, I implore us to work as a team to foster the
                success of this administration. To achieve this, therefore, we
                shall ensure that we strengthen our capacity to engage our rural
                communities to participate in decision-making for good
                governance. As an administration, we shall nurture innovative
                ideas and approaches towards better service delivery that seeks
                to be responsive and accountable to citizens' needs. And for
                this, we will not rest on our oars until we entrench sustainable
                integrated rural programs that will address the people's
                priority needs.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-4">
                Ladies and Gentlemen, I will not end this speech without
                soliciting for the support and cooperation of our traditional
                institution and the good people of Kachia local government
                irrespective of party leanings. Let's come together and find a
                workable solution that addresses priority areas we have
                identified to improve the lives of our people towards a new
                Kachia that all of us, our children, and future generations will
                be proud of.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-4">
                Finally, I wish to once again thank our esteemed guests and the
                good people of Kachia local government for taking out your time
                to grace this August occasion. I wish all a safe journey to your
                various destinations.
