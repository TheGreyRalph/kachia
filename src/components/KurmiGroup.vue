        <p class="text-body1 text-justify">
          The Kuturmi people, historically referred to as the "Kutumbawa," are believed to have originated from Kano. Following the Jihad wars of 1804-1807 AD, they migrated to their current settlements. This migration journey included other ethnic groups such as the Koro, Kuramah, and Gwandara.
        </p>
        <p class="text-body1 text-justify q-mt-md">
          They first settled in the fortified town of Old Iburu for several decades before dispersing in search of more farmland. The Kuturmi communities today are found in areas like Idon, Kallah, Afogo, Iburu, and Gafe, where they coexist with neighboring groups, creating a unique cultural blend.
