        History of Military Activities in Kachia
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      The exact date regarding the beginning of military activities in
      Kachia town remains unclear. However, a source mentioned that in
      May 1900, a patrol from the Royal West African Frontier Force
      (RWAFF) was sent by Lugard to explore the northern region. Their
      mission was to survey the land and find a suitable
      administrative headquarters for the Northern Protectorate as
      well as a site for military exercises.
    </p>

    <p>
      By August of that year, the patrol had collected topographical
      data for a location known as Kaduna. During their journey, the
      patrol team was attacked by a local pagan tribe, mistaking them
      for slave raiders who frequently traveled the same route from
      Zaria to Kaduna, Keffi, and Borno. This route, which is now a
      motorable road, connects Kano, Zaria, Kaduna, Kachia, Keffi, and
      beyond, passing through Benue to southern Nigeria.

      Military Range and Artillery
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kachia later became notable for housing Nigeria's famous
      military range and is the headquarters of the Nigeria Army Corps
      of Artillery. The town has hosted soldiers and military
      personnel from across the globe, including Europe, the Americas,
      and Asia, who came to train or participate in exercises. Despite
      its military prominence, Kachia has seen limited economic
      development over the years.

      During the Nigerian Civil War in the 1960s, Kachia was the
      planned site for the northern elements' counter-coup against
      General Aguiyi Ironsi’s regime. In July 1966, General Ironsi
      visited Kachia for military exercises, and rumors of unrest led
      him to summon General Hassan Usman Katsina, who was then a Major
      and Governor of the Northern Region. It is believed that General
      Katsina’s presence prevented the coup from taking place in
      Kachia.

      Establishment of Military Barracks in Kachia
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mal. Yashi Abdu, 103 years old, remembered the presence of
      military activity in Kachia for over a century. He served in the
      West African Frontier Force (WAFF) and recalled various barracks
      established over the years. Kachia had four main barracks:

    <ul>
      <li>The first barrack was in Ungwan Katanga.</li>
      <li>
        The second was located at Madaka, near the current Police
        Station.
      </li>
      <li>
        The third was in Nasarawa Kachia, near the Rimi Trees and
        south of the present-day Kachia market.
      </li>
      <li>
        The fourth, known as Ganabatara Barracks, was located outside
        the walls of Kachia town (Ganuwa), east of the present
        Government Secondary School Kachia.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Later, more military camps were established, such as the
      Engineer Barracks west of Kachia, the Nigeria Army
      Rehabilitation Centre, and the Nigeria Army School of Artillery
      (NASA). Despite the long-standing military presence, Kachia has
      struggled with economic growth, although its military
      significance is recognized internationally.
